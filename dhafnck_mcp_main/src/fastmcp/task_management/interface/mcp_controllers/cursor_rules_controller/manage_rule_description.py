🎯 RULE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM - Complete rule lifecycle operations with Vision System Integration

⭐ WHAT IT DOES: Handles all rule operations including CRUD, search, dependencies, and workflow management. Automatically enriches rules with vision insights, hierarchy analysis, and intelligent pattern detection.
📋 WHEN TO USE: For any rule-related operation from creation to synchronization, including hierarchy analysis and client management.
🎯 CRITICAL FOR: Rule governance, hierarchical rule systems, client synchronization, and maintaining development standards.

🤖 AI USAGE GUIDELINES:
• ALWAYS use 'info' action first to understand current rule system state
• USE 'analyze_hierarchy' before modifying rules to understand dependencies
• APPLY 'compose_nested_rules' for rule inheritance and composition
• LEVERAGE 'client_sync' for distributed rule consistency
• MONITOR with 'cache_status' and 'client_analytics' for performance
