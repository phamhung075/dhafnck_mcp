🎛️ RULE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM - Complete rule lifecycle operations with Vision System Integration

⭐ WHAT IT DOES: Handles all rule operations including CRUD, search, dependencies, and workflow management. Automatically enriches rules with vision insights, hierarchy analysis, and intelligent pattern detection.
📋 WHEN TO USE: For any rule-related operation from creation to synchronization, including hierarchy analysis and client management.
🎯 CRITICAL FOR: Rule governance, hierarchical rule systems, client synchronization, and maintaining development standards.

🤖 AI USAGE GUIDELINES:
• ALWAYS use 'info' action first to understand current rule system state
• USE 'analyze_hierarchy' before modifying rules to understand dependencies
• APPLY 'compose_nested_rules' for rule inheritance and composition
• LEVERAGE 'client_sync' for distributed rule consistency
• MONITOR with 'cache_status' and 'client_analytics' for performance

📝 PRACTICAL EXAMPLES FOR AI:
1. Understanding rule system:
   - action: "info"
   - Returns: Complete rule system state, available rules, hierarchy structure

2. Analyzing before modification:
   - action: "analyze_hierarchy", target: "security_rules"
   - Returns: Dependency tree, impact analysis, modification warnings

3. Composing complex rules:
   - action: "compose_nested_rules", target: "auth_rules", content: "inherit:base_security"
   - Returns: Composed rule set with inheritance applied

4. Client synchronization:
   - action: "sync_client", target: "client_123", content: "push"
   - Returns: Sync status, conflicts resolved, performance metrics

5. Performance monitoring:
   - action: "cache_status"
   - Returns: Cache hit rates, memory usage, optimization suggestions

🔍 DECISION TREES:
IF rule_operation_type == "read":
    IF need_hierarchy:
        USE "analyze_hierarchy"
    ELIF need_dependencies:
        USE "get_dependencies"
    ELSE:
        USE "info" or "list"
ELIF rule_operation_type == "modify":
    SEQUENCE:
        1. USE "analyze_hierarchy" (understand impact)
        2. USE "validate_rule_hierarchy" (pre-check)
        3. PERFORM modification
        4. USE "compose_nested_rules" (if inheritance needed)
        5. USE "sync_client" (propagate changes)
ELIF rule_operation_type == "sync":
    IF new_client:
        USE "register_client" → "authenticate_client" → "sync_client"
    ELSE:
        USE "client_diff" → "resolve_conflicts" → "sync_client"

📊 WORKFLOW PATTERNS:
1. Rule System Discovery:
   - info → list → analyze_hierarchy → get_dependencies

2. Rule Modification Flow:
   - backup → analyze_hierarchy → modify → validate_rule_hierarchy → sync_client

3. Client Onboarding:
   - register_client → authenticate_client → sync_client → client_status

4. Conflict Resolution:
   - client_diff → analyze conflicts → resolve_conflicts → sync_client → client_status

5. Performance Optimization:
   - cache_status → client_analytics → identify bottlenecks → optimize → monitor

🔄 VISION SYSTEM FEATURES (Automatic):
• Rule pattern detection and suggestion
• Hierarchy optimization recommendations
• Conflict prediction and prevention
• Performance bottleneck identification
• Security vulnerability detection in rules
• Best practice enforcement
• Automatic rule composition optimization

💡 ENHANCED PARAMETERS:
• action: Required. The rule operation to perform (see table above)
• target: Optional. Specific rule set, client ID, or resource identifier
• content: Optional. Additional data for the operation (JSON string for complex data)

📈 RESPONSE ENHANCEMENTS:
• workflow_guidance: AI-generated guidance for next steps
• hierarchy_insights: Understanding of rule relationships
• conflict_analysis: Automatic conflict detection results
• performance_metrics: Operation timing and efficiency data
• security_analysis: Rule security implications
• optimization_suggestions: Ways to improve rule efficiency

🛡️ RULE HIERARCHY PATTERNS:
• Global Rules: Organization-wide policies and standards
• Project Rules: Project-specific configurations and overrides
• Component Rules: Component-level customizations
• Inheritance Chain: Component → Project → Global (most specific wins)

🔐 CLIENT SYNCHRONIZATION PATTERNS:
• Push Sync: Server rules pushed to clients (authoritative)
• Pull Sync: Client requests latest rules from server
• Bidirectional Sync: Merge server and client rules with conflict resolution
• Selective Sync: Sync only specific rule categories or projects

💡 BEST PRACTICES FOR AI:
• Always check rule hierarchy before modifications
• Use backup before major rule changes
• Validate hierarchy after composition operations
• Monitor cache status for performance optimization
• Regularly check client_analytics for usage patterns
• Resolve conflicts promptly to maintain consistency
• Use enhanced_info for comprehensive system understanding

⚠️ IMPORTANT NOTES:
• Rule modifications affect all dependent rules in the hierarchy
• Client synchronization requires proper authentication
• Cache invalidation happens automatically on rule changes
• Conflict resolution uses configurable merge strategies
• Performance degrades with deeply nested rule hierarchies (>10 levels)
• Always validate rule syntax before applying changes

🛑 ERROR HANDLING:
• If required fields are missing, a clear error message is returned specifying which fields are needed
• Unknown actions return an error listing valid actions
• Internal errors are logged and returned with a generic error message
• Validation failures include specific rule violations
• Sync conflicts return detailed conflict information
