-- SUPABASE DATA CLEANUP SCRIPT FOR USER ISOLATION MIGRATION
-- ============================================================
-- Purpose: Clean old data and prepare for new user isolation system
-- Date: 2025-08-19
-- WARNING: This will DELETE existing data. Backup first!

-- ============================================================
-- PHASE 1: CREATE BACKUP TABLES (for safety)
-- ============================================================

-- Create backup tables with current data (in case rollback is needed)
CREATE TABLE backup_tasks AS SELECT * FROM tasks;
CREATE TABLE backup_projects AS SELECT * FROM projects;
CREATE TABLE backup_project_git_branchs AS SELECT * FROM project_git_branchs;
CREATE TABLE backup_agents AS SELECT * FROM agents;
CREATE TABLE backup_global_contexts AS SELECT * FROM global_contexts;
CREATE TABLE backup_project_contexts AS SELECT * FROM project_contexts;
CREATE TABLE backup_branch_contexts AS SELECT * FROM branch_contexts;
CREATE TABLE backup_task_contexts AS SELECT * FROM task_contexts;
CREATE TABLE backup_subtasks AS SELECT * FROM subtasks;
CREATE TABLE backup_task_dependencies AS SELECT * FROM task_dependencies;
CREATE TABLE backup_cursor_rules AS SELECT * FROM cursor_rules;

-- ============================================================
-- PHASE 2: REMOVE OLD SYSTEM DATA
-- ============================================================

-- Remove old system user data (UUID '00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000')
-- This clears legacy data that was using the system user as a placeholder

DELETE FROM task_dependencies WHERE user_id = '00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000';
DELETE FROM subtasks WHERE user_id = '00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000';
DELETE FROM task_contexts WHERE user_id = '00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000';
DELETE FROM branch_contexts WHERE user_id = '00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000';
DELETE FROM project_contexts WHERE user_id = '00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000';
DELETE FROM global_contexts WHERE user_id = '00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000';

DELETE FROM cursor_rules WHERE user_id = '00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000';

-- ============================================================
-- PHASE 3: CLEAN UP ORPHANED DATA
-- ============================================================

-- Remove tasks that reference non-existent projects
DELETE FROM tasks WHERE project_id NOT IN (SELECT id FROM projects);

-- Remove subtasks that reference non-existent tasks
DELETE FROM subtasks WHERE task_id NOT IN (SELECT id FROM tasks);

-- Remove task dependencies that reference non-existent tasks
DELETE FROM task_dependencies WHERE 
    task_id NOT IN (SELECT id FROM tasks) OR 
    dependency_id NOT IN (SELECT id FROM tasks);

-- Remove contexts that reference non-existent entities
DELETE FROM task_contexts WHERE context_id NOT IN (SELECT id FROM tasks);
DELETE FROM branch_contexts WHERE context_id NOT IN (SELECT id FROM project_git_branchs);
DELETE FROM project_contexts WHERE context_id NOT IN (SELECT id FROM projects);

-- Remove agents that reference non-existent projects
DELETE FROM agents WHERE project_id NOT IN (SELECT id FROM projects);

-- ============================================================
-- PHASE 4: RESET AUTO-INCREMENT SEQUENCES (if any)
-- ============================================================

-- Note: UUID-based tables don't use sequences, but if there are any serial fields:
-- ALTER SEQUENCE table_name_id_seq RESTART WITH 1;

-- ============================================================
-- PHASE 5: VERIFY CLEANUP
-- ============================================================

-- Count remaining records after cleanup
